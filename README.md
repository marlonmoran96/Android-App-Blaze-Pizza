# Android-App-Blaze-Pizza
App created with Android Studios. The app was for a school project and is not affiliated with the actual company. 
The app presents the user with a smaller version for Blaze Pizza’s menu. The user can view the menu before ordering and even click on menu items for more information regarding that item. 
The user can order pizza alone, or with an invite number of guests, which will show the user the total at the end of the order and even allow them to tip. 
Items will also be listed on the tip screen. After the tip page, the total, with tip included will be displayed for a single person or split up evenly for orders with a party bigger than one. Individual orders for each guest number, will also be displayed in a scrollable ticket. 
Additionally, the user can also choose to view more information about Blaze Pizza with the about button, which will re-direct the user to about page on Blaze Pizza’s actual website.
